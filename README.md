# A Simple Http File Server

## Background

If your company's in-house development machine cannot ***upload*** and ***download*** files using methods such as `SCP`, you can use this ***lightweight file server,*** as long as the machine has Python3.

## Usage

This is only a Python script. You can run it directly using Python.

``` bash
python3 pyhttp.py --port 8900
```

Then, you can use the network address to access the target machine. Such as http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8900
